Eat a balanced diet. Include a healthy balance of nutrient-rich carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and roots like potatoes. This will help make sure your body gets the right balance of the vital vitamins and minerals it needs in order to keep you strong and healthy. The recommended balance varies from diet plan to diet plan, and your ideal balance may be a little different from someone else's. However, some common options include:

    Eat a diet of 30% vegetables(dark colored vegetables are better, such as spinach) 20% fruit( eat the ones with more nutritional value, such as pomegranates), 20% carbohydrates (starches like wheat, rice and oats), 20% protein (which is found in meat, beans, and legumes), and 10% dairy products.[1]
    Eating a diet of 80% carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and starches like wheat, rice, and corn, 10% protein (which is found in meat, beans, and legumes), and 10% fats.
